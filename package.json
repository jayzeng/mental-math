Generate a JSON object representing a pool of mental math problems for kids in grades 2-4. The output must be a single JSON object with 7 keys: ADDITION, SUBTRACTION, MULT_BREAKDOWN, MULT_NEAR, DIVISION, FRACTIONS, ESTIMATION. Each key maps to an array of exactly 20 problem objects. Each problem object has these fields: id (string, unique, format CATEGORY_001), question (string, the math problem), answer (string, the correct answer as a single number or simple string), options (array of strings: exactly 4 choices for multiple-choice problems, or empty array [] for free-text problems), trick (string, a short kid-friendly mental math strategy hint), explanation (string, step-by-step solution), category (string, matching the key), difficulty (string: easy, medium, or hard — roughly equal mix). For ADDITION through FRACTIONS: 10 free-text (options=[]) and 10 multiple-choice (options has 4 items). For ESTIMATION: all 20 must be multiple-choice (options always has 4 items). For all MC problems the correct answer string must exactly match one of the 4 options. Category rules: ADDITION — rounding and splitting strategies (e.g. 68+47 → 70+47-2). SUBTRACTION — counting-up or multi-step breakdown (e.g. 250-97 → 97+3=100, +150=153). MULT_BREAKDOWN — split 2-digit × 1-digit (e.g. 23×5 = 20×5 + 3×5). MULT_NEAR — numbers near 10/20/50/100 as anchors (e.g. 19×6 = 20×6 - 6). DIVISION — simple division facts, sometimes with remainders (e.g. 65÷6). FRACTIONS — half, quarter, three-quarters of whole numbers (e.g. quarter of 80). ESTIMATION — approximate answers, all multiple-choice. All problem IDs must be globally unique. All answers must be mathematically correct.' | sed '/^```/d' | sed '/^$/d' > public/problems.json"
